<div><center><p><b><u>Thermal energy</b></u> is the total energy of an object's particles and atoms in relation to movement.</p>
<p><b>Temperature</b> is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of an object's particles.<br />
The faster the movement, the higher the temperature.</p>
<p>Thermal energy <b>always flows</b> from an object with a <b><i>higher temperature</b></i> to an object with <br /><b><i>lower temperature</b></i> until <b><i>equilibrium</b></i> is reached.</p>
<p>Thermal energy transfers in three different ways:  <a href="https://tn.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/conduction-heat-transfer-animation/unc-tv-science/" target="_blank">Conduction</a>, <a href="https://tn.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/convection-heat-transfer-animation/unc-tv-science/" target="_blank">Convection</a>, & <a href="https://tn.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/thermal-radiation-heat-transfer-animation/unc-tv-science/" target="_blank">Radiation</a></p></center></div>

<td>is the transfer of thermal energy in solids and liquids through direct contact. The hotter, faster moving particles bump into the colder, slower moving particles until all objects are the same temperature and equilibrium is reached. Holding a piece of ice is an example of thermal conduction. The ice steals thermal energy from our hand.</td>
<td>is the transfer of thermal energy in fluids (liquids and gases.) Differences in temperature and density drive convection currents. Cold, dense fluids sink and warm, less dense fluids rise. A lava lamp demonstrates convection with the &quot;lava&quot; rising as its heated by the bulb and sinking when it cools at the top, away from the source of heat.</td>
<td>is the transfer of thermal energy through electromagnetic waves. Radiation can move through all states of matter, but matter is not required. Thermal radiation can travel through empty space. The Earth is heated when the sun's energy is transferred to Earth's surface through electromagnetic waves.</td>
